- Example: Users accessing admin panels without proper permissions.

### 🔐 Cryptographic Failures
- Weak encryption or improper key management.
- Example: Using outdated algorithms like MD5.

### ⚠️ Injection Attacks
- SQL, Command, or Code injection leading to data breaches.
- Example: Unsanitized user input executing malicious queries.

### 🛠️ Insecure Design
- Flaws in system architecture or insecure coding practices.
- Example: Hardcoded credentials or insecure defaults.

### ⚙️ Security Misconfiguration
- Improper server or application settings.
- Example: Default passwords, verbose error messages.

### 🧩 Vulnerable & Outdated Components
- Use of outdated libraries or third-party tools.
- Example: Vulnerable CMS plugins or dependencies.

### 🔑 Identification & Authentication Failures
- Weak login mechanisms or session management.
- Example: Password reuse, weak password policies.

### 🧪 Software & Data Integrity Failures
- Unverified updates or tampered data.
- Example: Unsigned software updates.

### 📜 Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
